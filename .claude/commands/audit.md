Comprehensive codebase analysis: $ARGUMENTS

I'll read through your entire project to understand:
- Overall architecture and structure
- All components and their relationships  
- Dependencies and complexity
- What can be simplified
- What's essential vs nice-to-have

Examples:
- /audit for shipping readiness
- /audit focusing on performance
- /audit for team handoff

I'll create a full analysis report with streamlining recommendations.
