Fix UI consistency and layout across the frontend: $ARGUMENTS

I'll analyze your existing UI and make it consistent throughout.

Examples:
- /fix-ui make everything consistent
- /fix-ui focus on buttons and forms
- /fix-ui mobile layout issues

My process:
1. Scan all frontend files to understand current UI patterns
2. Identify inconsistencies in styling, spacing, colors, typography
3. Create or update a simple design system (uistylesheet.html)
4. Apply consistent styling across all components/pages
5. Fix layout issues and responsive problems
6. Ensure cohesive user experience

I'll focus on:
- Consistent colors, fonts, and spacing
- Matching button styles and interactions
- Uniform form layouts and inputs
- Responsive design that works everywhere
- Clean, professional appearance

I won't over-engineer - just make it look like one cohesive app.
