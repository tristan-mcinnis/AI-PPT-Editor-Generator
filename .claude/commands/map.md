Create a comprehensive codebase map: $ARGUMENTS

I'll explore and document:
- File structure and organization
- Key components and their roles
- Data flow and dependencies
- Entry points and main features
- Areas of complexity

Examples:
- /map the entire project
- /map just the backend
- /map frontend components

This gives us both a clear picture before making changes.
